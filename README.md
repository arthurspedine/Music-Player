# Music Player

This music player was created for a personal objective to practice programming skills and learn to debug own code.

These songs: 
- Motivational, by Infraction
- My Eyes, by Travis Scott
- Feelings are Fatal, by Mxmtoon
  
The songs listed above are fully copyrighted by their respective owners. I have selected them solely for educational purposes.

Feel free to add more songs to the folder. Just pay attention to the file extension; try to use .mp3 or .wav files.
